            "We believe that education provides an opportunity to empower yourself. For this reason, it becomes increasingly important that education must be accessible to all. Being able to relate and apply that knowledge in reality is also crucial. We have identified that socio-economic background seems to be limiting many students from accessing the standard of education they deserve. With this in mind, the LRC was born. ",
